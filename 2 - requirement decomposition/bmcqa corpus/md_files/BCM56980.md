## Overview

The Broadcom® BCM56980 family is a class of high-performance, high-connectivity network switching devices supporting up to 32x 400GbE, 64x 200GbE, or 128x 100GbE switch ports. The device family features a maximum of 32 integrated BlackhawkCores, each with eight integrated 50G PAM4 SerDes transceivers and associated PCS for native support of XFI, 10GBASE-KR/CR/SR/ER/LR, 40GBASE-KR4/CR4/SR4/ER4/LR4, 50GbE, and 100GBASE-KR4/CR4/SR4/ER4/LR4. The BCM56980 delivers high-bandwidth, glueless network connectivity up to 12.8 Tb/s on a single chip.

The BCM56980 is a family of Ethernet switches designed to address performance, capacity, and service requirements for next-generation data center and cloud computing environments. The BCM56980 architecture delivers complete Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 3 (L3) switching and routing capabilities with maximum port density, while consuming minimum power, latency, and board footprint. Software compatibility is maintained across the StrataXGS® product portfolio to simplify customer designs and reduce customer time-to-market.

As server interfaces transition to higher Ethernet speeds and virtualization continues to increase link utilization, data center networks are demanding switches with dense 100GbE and 400GbE connectivity at the edge and aggregation layers. With up to 256 50G PAM4 SerDes that conform to IEEE 802.3bs and 802.3cd specifications, and full flexibility in configuring 10/25/40/50/100/200/400GbE ports, a single BCM56980 switching chip can be used to build scalable, cost-effective Top of Rack (ToR) switch, blade switch, and aggregation equipment across the entire data center. The BCM56980 has extensive features to address the rapidly increasing scale of data center network deployments and distributed computing applications: large L2 and L3 forwarding capacity supporting numerous multi-pathing technologies; enhanced instrumentation; switching, 
migration, and robust buffer performance including many to-one burst absorption capabilities that assist in TCP incast 
scenarios.
With the BCM56980 device, customers can build data 
centers with much higher server node counts while 
simultaneously improving per-port power efficiency. The 
BCM56980 is built using state-of-the-art silicon process

## Chapter 1: Introduction

The Broadcom BCM56980 family consists of several devices with flexible port configurations. All switching features and table sizes are identical within each device, except as noted in the following tables.

NOTE: The BCM56980 supports PAM4-based SerDes controller cores, BlackhawkCore (BC), and MerlinCore (TSCm).

### Table 1: BCM56980 Family I/O Bandwidth and Throughput

| Device   | I/O Bandwidth (Tb/s) | BC (#) | Dedicated Mgmt.  TSCm (#) | Typical Configuration           |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| BCM56980 | 12.8                 | 32     | 2                         | 32 × 400G, 128 × 100G           |
| BCM56982 | 8.0                  | 20     | 2                         | 20 × 400G, 48 × 100G + 8 × 400G |
| BCM56983 | 6.4                  | 16     | 1                         | 16 × 400G                       |
| BCM56984 | 6.4                  | 32     | 2                         | 64 × 100G (NRZ only)            |

The BCM56980 family includes the configurations described in the following table.

### Table 2: BCM56980 Device Family Port Configurations

| Device   | 400 Gb/s   | 200 Gb/s   | 100 Gb/s    | 50 Gb/s     | 10 Gb/s     |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| BCM56980 | 32 maximum | 64 maximum | 128 maximum | 144 maximum | 144 maximum |
| BCM56982 | 20 maximum | 40 maximum | 80 maximum  | 144 maximum | 144 maximum |
| BCM56983 | 16 maximum | 32 maximum | 64 maximum  | 72 maximum  | 72 maximum  |
| BCM56984 | —          | —          | 64 maximum  | 128 maximum | 144 maximum |

The BCM56980 supports a maximum of 144 front-panel ports by using 32 BlackhawkCores in the eight pipelines. Ports can be configured only as Ethernet ports.

NOTE: The BCM56983 uses only four of the eight pipelines, which reduces the supported number of front-panel ports to 72.

In addition to the BlackhawkCores, the device contains one MerlinCore that can be used to support a maximum of two auxiliary ports. The MerlinCore consists of four SerDes lanes. If an auxiliary port is configured in single SerDes lane mode, lane 0 or lane 2 should be used. If the port is configured as RXAUI mode, either lanes 0 and 1, or lanes 2 and 3 should be used. If a single auxiliary port is used, the four-lane XAUI port mode should be used.

The device also supports a four-lane PCIe interface that can be operated at Gen1, Gen2, and Gen3 speed. The PCIe interface is typically connected to the root complex of the host CPU as an x1, x2, or x4 PCIe Gen1, Gen2, or Gen3 interface.

### 2.2 Target Applications

#### 2.2.1 100GbE/200GbE/400GbE Aggregation Switch

Data center switching represents a fast growing segment of the Ethernet switching market and is the primary driver behind 100GbE, 200GbE, and 400GbE port growth. Data centers are where computer resources (servers or blade chassis) are centralized and managed in a structured way utilizing high-efficiency Ethernet connectivity. A single 32x 400GbE, 64x 200GbE, or 128x 100GbE aggregation switch (as shown in the following figure), can be built using a single BCM56980 device.

### 3.1 BlackhawkCore SerDes

The BlackhawkCore (BC or TSCbc) SerDes is the versatile physical layer interface for the BCM56980, and is specifically designed to support up to 400 Gb/s. This serial interface supports the following features:

- Octal SerDes block supporting eight serial links.
- Support for data rates of 10.3125 Gb/s up to 53.125 Gb/s per serial link.

The BCM56980 device family incorporates PAM4-based SerDes Core (BC). This macro allows the device to support low-latency throughput, oversubscription capability, and Flexport configuration. The BC macro consists of the digital control logic and a BlackhawkCore analog block. The terms BC, TSCbc, and BlackhawkCore are used interchangeably in this document.

The BCM56980 device has 32 BlackhawkCores. Each BlackhawkCore contains eight SerDes lanes. Each BlackhawkCore lane can be configured as a single individual port, or multiple lanes can be aggregated into a single port.

The 32 BlackhawkCores in the device are separated into the following eight pipes:

- Pipe-0: BlackhawkCore [31:0]
- Pipe-1: BlackhawkCore [63:32]
- Pipe-2: BlackhawkCore [95:64]
- Pipe-3: BlackhawkCore [127:96]
- Pipe-4: BlackhawkCore [159:128]
- Pipe-5: BlackhawkCore [191:160]
- Pipe-6: BlackhawkCore [223:192]
- Pipe-7: BlackhawkCore [255:224]

The device contains 32 BlackhawkCores divided into 8 pipes of 4 BlackhawkCores, which enables up to 12800G of I/O bandwidth. See Figure 3 for the BlackhawkCore configuration within each pipe.

NOTE: The lane-swapping mode is configurable.

For PAM4 modes without FEC (single lane 50G, dual lane 100G, 200G) or using RS528 FEC (single lane 50G, dual lane 100G), the lane speed is 51.5625G.

RS272 FEC is a Broadcom proprietary protocol to achieve lower latency. When operating in RS272, all ports within the upper- or lower-half four lanes of a BlackhawkCore must operate at the same FEC (RS272). For example, in a 2 × 100G configuration (each 100G port is 2 × 50G), one 100G port cannot operate at RS544 FEC while the other operates at RS272 FEC.

NOTE: The BCM56980 supports simultaneous operation of all seven port speeds (also called speed modes) listed in this table across various ports of the chip. However, within a single BlackhawkCore, there are restrictions on which port modes can coexist. For more information, refer to the BCM56980 Hardware Design Guide (56980-DG1xx).

### 3.2 BlackhawkCore Octal SerDes Configuration Guidelines

Each device has up to 32 BlackhawkCores, depending on the device part number. The BlackhawkCores are organized into eight pipes. None of the eight pipes can exceed 1/8 of the total switching throughput. In configurations where not all ports are active, bandwidth should be balanced across all eight pipelines.

A physical port consists of one or more SerDes lane in the device. There are up to 32 BlackhawkCores, each with eight physical SerDes lanes. A logical port is defined as a front-panel, CPU, or loopback port. The total number of logical ports per device is 160. Out of 160, up to 144 ports, excluding the management port, can be assigned as front-panel ports. The rest are used as CPU and internal loopback ports.

NOTE: The BCM56983 device supports 72 front-panel ports because only four pipes are active. Each pipe supports up to 18 general ports.

Physical-port to logical-port numbering limitations exist across pipes that are integrated into the SDK software.

#### 3.2.1 Flexport Configuration

The BlackhawkCore supports the ability to change a port configuration (speed and number of lanes per port) at runtime without affecting the operation of the other ports or requiring the device to be reset. If the SerDes continue to be associated with the same logical ports, then the Flexport configuration amounts to a speed change and can be handled automatically by the BlackhawkCore driver. Logical ports can be added, removed, or associated with a different number of SerDes through user API calls. The configuration of two SerDes within a BlackhawkCore can be changed without affecting the ports using the remaining SerDes.

Two PLLs are in a BlackhawkCore: PLL0 (secondary) and PLL1 (primary). Each of the two PLLs can generate one of the three basic port frequencies: 10G-NRZ (20.625 GHz), 25G-NRZ (25.78125 GHz), or 50G-PAM4 (26.5625 GHz). The SDK software sets the primary PLL frequency after collecting all available port speeds allocated within a BlackhawkCore. Changing the secondary VCO without a reset is allowed if no other port in the BlackhawkCore is using the secondary VCO. However, changing the primary VCO requires a BlackhawkCore reset.

### 3.3 10G Quad MerlinCore SerDes

The MerlinCore SerDes is the management-port physical-layer interface for the BCM56980 specifically designed to support up to two 10 Gb/s management ports on the single MerlinCore. This serial interface supports the following features:

- The MerlinCore SerDes has four serial links and can support the following:
- Two ports in single-lane mode.
- Two ports in RXAUI mode.
- One port in XAUI mode.
- Single-lane mode supports 1000BASE-x, SGMII, 2500BASE-X, SFI, XFI, or 10GBASE-KR.
- Two-lane mode supports RXAUI.
- Four-lane mode supports XAUI.
- There is no support for mixing a two-lane and a four-lane port with any other port type.
- All single-lane port types can be mixed.

NOTE: When a 2500BASE-X port is mixed with a SFI, XFI, or 10GBASE-KR port, the transmit jitter on the 2500BASE-X port violates the IEEE specification.

### 3.4 PCIe

The PCIe interface provided by the BCM56980 switch conforms to the PCIe Gen3 specification and supports Gen1 and Gen2. The BCM56980 PCIe interface supports x1, x2, or x4 wide connections (8.0G link speed or 7.88 Gb/s data rate in each direction). No external glue logic is required to support this interface. The protocols and electrical requirements of the PCIe specifications are strictly implemented.

The device provides strap signals to limit the maximum link speed and link width of the PCIe interface. The internal pulls on the strap signals cause the device to default to allowing a maximum link width of x4 and PCIe Gen3 link speeds.

For all PCIe speeds, the design requires QSPI flash memory programmed with Broadcom-provided firmware to be connected to the IP_QSPI interface on the device, and the device must be strapped to perform a download from this memory. This is required because the firmware configures the PCIe interface into a mode that is functional and compliant to the Gen3 specification. The exact strap settings and design requirements are as follows:

- BOOT_DEV[2:0] = 3’b000
- MHOST0_BOOT_DEV = 1’b1
- PCIE_FORCE_GENTYPE[1:0] = 2’b00
- QSPI flash memory is programmed with Broadcom provided firmware
- QSPI flash memory is connected to IP_QSPI interface

NOTE: Design requirements include a QSPI flash memory that contains the Broadcom-provided PCIe firmware for all PCIe operating modes. The device must also be strapped to download and execute the code from this flash memory for the PCIe interface to be functional.

### 3.5 LED

There are three LED processors in the BCM56980 device that support up to 256 physical ports plus two management ports. Each LED processor includes a two-wire (clock and data) LED interface to control system LEDs. Both LED_CLK and LED_DATA are outputs. When active, LED_CLK is a 5 MHz clock. Both signals are held low during periods of inactivity. A single LED refresh cycle consists of clocking out a programmable number of LED_DATA bits. The LED_DATA signal is pulsed high at the start of each LED refresh cycle. The LED refresh cycle is repeated approximately every 30 ms to refresh the LEDs. The LED timing diagrams are shown in the following two figures.

#### Figure 5: Single LED Refresh Cycle

### 3.6 MIIM

The CPU Management Interface Controller (CMIC) supports the IEEE 802.3u standard MIIM interface: a two-wire serial bus controlled by the CMIC that allows register access to all the PHYs in the system. Data from the PHY can be read/write using this interface. The two signals for MIIM are MDC (clock) and MDIO (bidirectional data). The CPU uses this interface to program the internal and external PHY registers. The MIIM interface can be configured to support Clause 45.

### 3.7 Broadcom Serial Controller

The BCM56980 switch provides a Broadcom Serial Control (BSC) interface to communicate with other devices that support a similar interface. This interface is a NXP I2C-compatible interface. The signals supported are shown in the following figure.

#### Figure 7: BSC Interface

| BSC\_SCL | Broadcom Device | BSC\_SDA |
| -------- | --------------- | -------- |

The BSC interface is supported in master mode only. The supported BSC data protocol format is big endian, which is consistent with the NXP I2C protocol supported by other vendors.

### 3.8 JTAG

A standard JTAG interface is provided for boundary scan operations. This interface uses a standard five-pin interface and supports operational speeds up to 12.5 MHz.

Traditional JTAG provides the capability to test for opens and shorts when the device is mounted on the PCB. Because current technology requires that most high-speed differential signals must be AC-coupled, the traditional DC test for opens and shorts can produce false results. To provide a means of testing high-speed differential signals, the BCM56980 family supports the latest JTAG specification, IEEE 1149.6 (also known as AC-JTAG). AC-JTAG can enable the detection of manufacturing faults on high-speed differential lines on the PCB. The device incorporates independent transceivers with low-load capacitance to avoid any adverse effect on the high-speed differential signals. The signals supported are shown in the following figure.

#### Figure 8: AC JTAG Test Block

| -------------- | -------------- |
| JTAG TX        | JTAG RX        |

### 3.9 BroadSync

The BroadSync interface provides a way to externalize the timing information and clock signals generated by the global timing module, an internal clock adjustment block. The interface can also be used as an input to receive timing from an external source or synchronize timing information in a multichip system. The BroadSync interface is used by ordinary clocks (OCs) in either a master or slave role. When the OC is a master, the BroadSync interface is configured as an input, accepting timing information from external hardware. When the OC is a slave, BroadSync is configured as an output, providing timing information to external hardware.

The BroadSync interface consists of three bidirectional signals that can be configured as outputs (master mode) or inputs (slave mode):

- TS_SYNC – Heartbeat clock. Signals the start of the transmission of the synchronized time value.
- TS_BIT_CLK – Bit clock. Used for the data transfer of the synchronized time value.
- TS_TIME_VAL – Time code or synchronized time value.

#### 3.9.1 Slave Mode – BroadSync Signals as Inputs

In slave mode, the external hardware provides the bit clock and heartbeat clock signals as shown in the following figure. During each heartbeat period, the external hardware also shifts in the time code values. The shifted time value corresponds to the time of the most recent rising edge of the heartbeat signal. The heartbeat and time code signals are sampled off the negative edge of the bit clock.

##### Figure 9: BroadSync Interface Timing Diagram

| Bit Clock | Heartbeat | Time Code | Lock | T\[79] | T\[0] | A\[7] | A\[0] | C\[7] | C\[0] |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ---- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |

#### 3.9.2 Master Mode – BroadSync Signals as Outputs

In master mode, the device provides the bit clock, heartbeat, and time code signals and enables the external devices to synchronize their behavior with that of the master. The signals supported are shown in the following figure.

##### Figure 10: BroadSync Interface

| TS\_SYNC | Broadcom | TS\_BIT\_CLK | Device | TS\_TIME\_VAL |

NOTE: The maximum per rail current in Table 13 is used to design system power supply. Each supply rail current may not track each other with process variations (that is, analog current goes up while digital current goes down). The maximum system power in Table 14 is used for thermal design calculation.

#### Table 14: System Thermal Design Maximum Power

| Device               | Low-Latency Mode System Powera | Normal-Latency Mode System Powera |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| BCM56980             | 365W                           | 350W                              |
| BCM56982 (estimated) | 265W                           | —                                 |

a. Low-latency mode is the default mode and uses the maximum internal clocks of 1325 MHz core and 1000 MHz PP. Normal-latency mode reduces the PP clock to 662.5 MHz, while keeping the core clock at 1325 MHz.

NOTE: These maximum power values assume the use of the mandatory AVS feature. Refer to the BCM56980 Hardware Design Guidelines (56980-DG1xx) for AVS details.

| PCIe SerDes (PVDD0P8 and VDD0P8) | 116 (PCIe\_PVDD0P8 = 16 mW and PCIe\_VDD0P8 = 100 mW) optional |

NOTE: It is a design requirement that all SerDes cores must be connected to their specified supply rails. The Broadcom SDK ensures the digital portion of unused SerDes cores are held in reset and the analog portion of the core is placed into a power-down mode. This achieves the desired power savings automatically for unused SerDes cores.

#### 5.6.3 BlackhawkCore (50G) Interface

The device serial interface confirms to IEEE 802.3bs and 802.3cd specifications:

- Octal SerDes block supporting eight serial links.
- Supports line rates from 10.3125 Gb/s to 56.25 Gb/s (PAM4 56.25 Gb/s or NRZ 28.125 Gb/s).
- Includes a 14-tap DFE with adaptive control and VGA with AGC.
- Programmable RX equalizer with 0 to 8 dB boost, approximately 0.5 dB/step.
- Transmitter, 5-tap FIR with precursor, main, and post cursor taps.
- CML driver with 2 × 50Ω internal termination.
- Controlled peak-to-peak amplitude.
- The receiver inputs includes on-die AC caps with a low corner freq, ~70 kHz, and in most cases, an external AC cap is not needed. The main limitation is that the absolute maximum RX input voltage must not exceed 1.1V, and so limits the maximum input Vcm to ~0.9V. The peak amplitude limit should not be exceeded over all PVT and any transient effects, such as reflections and power supply ramps.

#### 5.6.4 MerlinCore (TSC4-M) Interface

The device serial interface supports the following features:

- Quad SerDes block supporting four serial links.
- Supports line rates of 1.25G, up to 12.5 Gbaud per serial link. Oversampling mode is used if the speed is below 2.5G.
- Includes a 5-tap DFE with adaptive control and VGA with AGC.
- Programmable RX equalizer with 0 dB to 8 dB boost, approximately 0.5 dB/step.
- Transmitter with 5-tap FIR.
- SST driver with 2 × 50Ω internal termination.
- Controlled peak-to-peak amplitude.

The serial interface operating conditions are shown in the following table and figure.

NOTE: BSC_SCL and BSC_SDA are open-drain outputs. The rise time is dependent on the strength of the external pull-up resistor, which must be selected to meet the rise-time requirement.

The device drives the BSC_SCL clock with a programmable speed of 100 kHz or 400 kHz based on the mode bit called MODE_400. The device drives BSC_SDA during a write operation and samples BSC_SDA during a read operation.

## Chapter 7: Thermal Specifications

### 7.1 Thermal Requirements

The following two tables provide device thermal specifications. The maximum θJA is a function of the maximum allowed ambient air temperature of the system and is given for ambient air temperatures of 50°C and 70°C. The device requires steady state maximum junction temperature at 110°C. It allows an excursion of Junction temperature up to 125°C with maximum period of four days per year. During the excursion period, the device continues to operate but its performance may degrade.

### 7.2 Package Thermal Specifications

The following table shows the preliminary package thermal specifications with a heat sink for various airflow levels. To maintain a junction temperature below the maximum specified junction temperature, the θJA must be smaller than the maximum calculated θJA for the device. A heat sink and airflow is required (see Section 7.3, Heat Sink).

#### Table 55: Estimated Package Thermal Specifications (220x160x29 mm Heat Sink with Vapor Chamber, 2s2p PCB)

| Parameters                         | Symbol | Value | Unit |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| JB (junction-to-board)             | JB     | 0.24  | °C W |
| JC (junction-to-case)              | JC     | 0.06  | °C W |
| JA (junction-to-ambient), 200 LFM  | JA     | 0.22  | °C W |
| JA (junction-to-ambient), 400 LFM  | JA     | 0.16  | °C W |
| JA (junction-to-ambient), 600 LFM  | JA     | 0.14  | °C W |

| JA (junction-to-ambient), 1000 LFM | JA     | 0.13  | °C/W |

NOTE: The package thermal number is based on a 220 mm × 160 mm × 29 mm heat sink with a vapor chamber base. The data in Table 55 is intended as a starting point for thermal analysis. Further simulation is required for each specific application.

### 7.3 Heat Sink

#### 7.3.1 Heat Sink Selection

The device is required to be used with a heat sink. The end-use thermal environment combined with the operating mode of the device dictates the required thermal characteristics (size, thermal resistance, and so forth) of the heat sink.

#### 7.3.2 Heat Sink Attachment

For heat sink attachment guidelines (including loading forces up to 110 lb), refer to the BCM56980 Hardware Design Guidelines (56980-DG1xx).

### 7.4 On-Die Thermal Monitors

The device contains numerous on-die thermal monitors. These thermal monitors provide junction temperature information from fixed locations across the die. The output from some of the thermal monitors is used by the various SerDes cores to perform real-time adaptation of the receiver as a function of die temperature. The other thermal monitors are provided as a means of allowing software to monitor the junction temperature of the device. The locations of the thermal monitors relative to the device’s die and package are shown in Figure 39.
