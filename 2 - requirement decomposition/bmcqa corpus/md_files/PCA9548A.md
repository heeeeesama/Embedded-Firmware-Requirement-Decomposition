# PCA9548A 8-channel I2C-bus switch with reset Rev. 5.1 — 1 October 2015 Product data sheet

## 1. General description

The PCA9548A is an octal bidirectional translating switch controlled via the I2C-bus. The SCL/SDA upstream pair fans out to eight downstream pairs, or channels. Any individual SCx/SDx channel or combination of channels can be selected, determined by the contents of the programmable control register.

An active LOW reset input allows the PCA9548A to recover from a situation where one of the downstream I2C-buses is stuck in a LOW state. Pulling the RESET pin LOW resets the I2C-bus state machine and causes all the channels to be deselected as does the internal Power-on reset function.

The pass gates of the switches are constructed such that the VDD pin can be used to limit the maximum high voltage which will be passed by the PCA9548A. This allows the use of different bus voltages on each pair, so that 1.8 V or 2.5 V or 3.3 V parts can communicate with 5 V parts without any additional protection. External pull-up resistors pull the bus up to the desired voltage level for each channel. All I/O pins are 6 V tolerant.

[1] HVQFN24 package die supply ground is connected to both the VSS pin and the exposed center pad. The VSS pin must be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board-level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the board, and for proper heat conduction through the board thermal vias need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

## 6. Functional description

Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PCA9548A”.

### 6.1 Device address

Following a START condition, the bus master must output the address of the slave it is accessing. The address of the PCA9548A is shown in Figure 5. To conserve power, no internal pull-up resistors are incorporated on the hardware selectable address pins and they must be pulled HIGH or LOW.

#### Fig 5. Slave address

| 1                         | 1 | 1 | 0 | A2 | A1 | A0 | R/W |
| ------------------------- | - | - | - | -- | -- | -- | --- |
| fixed hardware selectable |   |   |   |    |    |    |     |

The last bit of the slave address defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.

### 6.2 Control register

Following the successful acknowledgement of the slave address, the bus master will send a byte to the PCA9548A, which will be stored in the control register. If multiple bytes are received by the PCA9548A, it will save the last byte received. This register can be written and read via the I2C-bus.

#### 6.2.1 Control register definition

One or several SCx/SDx downstream pair, or channel, is selected by the contents of the control register. This register is written after the PCA9548A has been addressed. The contents of the control byte are used to determine which channel is to be selected. When a channel is selected, the channel will become active after a STOP condition has been placed on the I2C-bus. This ensures that all SCx/SDx lines will be in a HIGH state when the channel is made active, so that no false conditions are generated at the time of connection.

| 1    | X    | X    | X    | X    | X    | X    | X    | channel 7 enabled  |

Remark: Multiple channels can be enabled at the same time. Example: B7 = 0, B6 = 1, B5 = 0, B4 = 0, B3 = 1, B2 = 1, B1 = 0, B0 = 0, means that channels 7, 5, 4, 1 and 0 are disabled and channels 6, 3, and 2 are enabled. Care should be taken not to exceed the maximum bus capacitance. Default condition is all zeroes.

### 6.3 RESET input

The RESET input is an active LOW signal which may be used to recover from a bus fault condition. By asserting this signal LOW for a minimum of tw(rst)L, the PCA9548A will reset its register and I2C-bus state machine and will deselect all channels. The RESET input must be connected to VDD through a pull-up resistor.

### 6.4 Power-on reset

When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9548A in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At this point, the reset condition is released and the PCA9548A register and I2C-bus state machine are initialized to their default states (all zeroes) causing all the channels to be deselected. Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V for at least 5 s in order to reset the device.

### 6.5  Voltage translation

The pass gate transistors of the PCA9548A are constructed such that the VDD voltage can
be used to limit the maximum voltage that will be passed from one I2C-bus to another.

#### Fig 7. Pass gate voltage versus supply voltage

(3) minimum

Figure 7 shows the voltage characteristics of the pass gate transistors (note that the
PCA9548A is only tested at the points specified in Section 11 “Static characteristics” of
this data sheet). In order for the PCA9548A to act as a voltage translator, the Vo(sw)
voltage should be equal to, or lower than the lowest bus voltage. For example, if the main
bus was running at 5 V, and the downstream buses were 3.3 V and 2.7 V, then Vo(sw)
should be equal to or below 2.7 V to effectively clamp the downstream bus voltages.
Looking at Figure 7, we see that Vo(sw)(max) will be at 2.7 V when the PCA9548A supply
voltage is 3.5 V or lower, so the PCA9548A supply voltage could be set to 3.3 V. Pull-up
resistors can then be used to bring the bus voltages to their appropriate levels (see
Figure 14).

More Information can be found in Application Note AN262: PCA954X family of I2C/SMBus
multiplexers and switches.

## 7. Characteristics of the I2C-bus

The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.

### 7.1 Bit transfer

One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 8).

#### Fig 8. Bit transfer

### 7.2 START and STOP conditions

Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP condition (P) (see Figure 9).

### 7.3 System configuration

A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’, a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 10).

#### Fig 10. System configuration

### 7.4 Acknowledge

The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.

A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
each byte. Also, a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so that the SDA line is stable
LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up and hold
times must be taken into account.

A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
condition.

### 7.5  Bus transactions

[1] Pass gate propagation delay is calculated from the 20 typical Ron and the 15 pF load capacitance.

[2] After this period, the first clock pulse is generated.

[3] A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (referred to the VIH(min) of the SCL signal) in order to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.

[4] The maximum tHD;DAT could be 3.45 s and 0.9 s for Standard-mode and Fast-mode, but must be less than the maximum of tVD;DAT or tVD;ACK by a transition time. This maximum must only be met if the device does not stretch the LOW period (tLOW) of the SCL signal. If the clock stretches the SCL, the data must be valid by the set-up time before it releases the clock.

[5] Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.

[6] Measurements taken with 1 k pull-up resistor and 50 pF load.

## 14. Soldering of SMD packages

This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow soldering description”.

### 14.1 Introduction to soldering

Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high densities that come with increased miniaturization.

### 14.2 Wave and reflow soldering

Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:

- Through-hole components
- Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board

Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, due to an increased probability of bridging.

The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.

Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:

- Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
- Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
- The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
- Package placement
- Inspection and repair
- Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

### 14.3 Wave soldering

Key characteristics in wave soldering are:

- Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are exposed to the wave
- Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

### 14.4 Reflow soldering

Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:

- Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 21) than a SnPb process, thus reducing the process window
- Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process window for a mix of large and small components on one board
- Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with Table 10 and 11

#### Table 10. SnPb eutectic process (from J-STD-020D)

| Package thickness (mm) | Package reflow temperature (C) | Package reflow temperature (C) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |

|                        | < 350                          | 350                            |
| < 2.5                  | 235                            | 220                            |

|                        | < 350                          | 350 to 2000                    | > 2000                         |

| 1.6 to 2.5             | 260                            | 250                            | 245                            |
| > 2.5                  | 250                            | 245                            | 245                            |

Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all times.

Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow soldering, see Figure 21.
