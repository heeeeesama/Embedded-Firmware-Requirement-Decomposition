## 3 Description

The LM75B and LM75C are industry-standard digital temperature sensors with an integrated Sigma-Delta analog-to-digital converter and I²C interface. The LM75 provides 9-bit digital temperature readings with an accuracy of ±2°C from -25°C to 100°C and ±3°C over -55°C to 125°C.

Communication is accomplished over a 2-wire interface which operates up to 400kHz. The LM75 has three address pins, allowing up to eight LM75 devices to operate on the same 2-wire bus. The LM75 has a dedicated over-temperature output (O.S.) with programmable limit and hysteresis. This output has programmable fault tolerance, which allows the user to define the number of consecutive error conditions that must occur before O.S. is activated.

The wide temperature and supply range and I²C interface make the LM75 ideal for applications including:

•Base stations

•Electronic test equipment

•Office electronics

•Personal computers

•Any system where thermal management is critical

The LM75B and LM75C are available in SOIC package or VSSOP package.

| O.S. Output Sink Current          |      | 10                            | mA   |      |
| Storage temperature, Tstg         | –65  | 150                           | °C   |      |

(1) Absolute Maximum Ratings indicate limits beyond which damage to the device may occur. DC and AC electrical specifications do not apply when operating the device beyond its rated operating conditions.

(2) When the input voltage (VI) at any pin exceeds the power supplies (VI &#x3C; GND or VI > +VS) the current at that pin should be limited to 5 mA. The 20-mA maximum package input current rating limits the number of pins that can safely exceed the power supplies with an input current of 5 mA to four.

(1) All part numbers of the LM75 will operate properly over the +VS supply voltage range of 3 V to 5.5 V. The devices are tested and specified for rated accuracy at their nominal supply voltage. Accuracy will typically degrade 1°C/V of variation in +VS as it varies from the nominal value.

(2) For best accuracy, minimize output loading. Higher sink currents can affect sensor accuracy with internal heating. This can cause an error of 0.64°C at full rated sink current and saturation voltage based on junction-to-ambient thermal resistance.

(3) Limits are specified to AOQL (Average Outgoing Quality Level).

(4) Typicals are at TA = 25°C and represent most likely parametric norm.

(5) The conversion-time specification is provided to indicate how often the temperature data is updated. The LM75 can be accessed at any time and reading the Temperature Register will yield result from the last temperature conversion. When the LM75 is accessed, the conversion that is in process will be interrupted and it will be restarted after the end of the communication. Accessing the LM75 continuously without waiting at least one conversion time between communications will prevent the device from updating the Temperature Register with a new temperature conversion result. Consequently, the LM75 should not be accessed continuously with a wait time of less than 300 ms.

(6) O.S. Delay is user programmable up to 6 “over limit” conversions before O.S. is set to minimize false tripping in noisy environments.

(7) Default values set at power up.

### 6.6 Digital DC Characteristics

(1) All part numbers of the LM75 will operate properly over the +VS supply voltage range of 3 V to 5.5 V. The devices are tested and specified for rated accuracy at their nominal supply voltage. Accuracy will typically degrade 1°C/V of variation in +VS as it varies from the nominal value.

(2) Limits are specified to AOQL (Average Outgoing Quality Level).

(3) Typicals are at TA = 25°C and represent most likely parametric norm.

## 7 Detailed Description

### 7.1 Overview

The LM75 temperature sensor incorporates a band-gap type temperature sensor and 9-bit ADC (Sigma-Delta
Analog-to-Digital Converter). The temperature data output of the LM75 is available at all times via the I2C bus. If
a conversion is in progress, it will be stopped and restarted after the read. A digital comparator is also
incorporated that compares a series of readings, the number of which is user-selectable, to user-programmable
setpoint and hysteresis values. The comparator trips the O.S. output line, which is programmable for mode and
polarity.

The LM75B contains all the functionality of the LM75C, plus two additional features:

- The LM75B has an integrated low-pass filter on both the SDA and the SCL line. These filters increase
communications reliability in noisy environments.
- The LM75B also has a bus fault timeout feature. If the SDA line is held low for longer than tTIMEOUT (see I2C
Digital Switching Characteristics) the LM75B will reset to the IDLE state (SDA set to high impedance) and
wait for a new start condition. The TIMEOUT feature is not functional in Shutdown Mode.

### 7.2 Functional Block Diagram

### 7.3 Feature Description

#### 7.3.1 Digital Temperature Sensor

The LM75 is an industry-standard digital temperature sensor with an integrated Sigma-Delta analog-to-digital
converter and I2C interface. The LM75 provides 9-bit digital temperature readings with an accuracy of ±2°C from
–25°C to 100°C and ±3°C over –55°C to 125°C.

The LM75 operates with a single supply from 2.7 V to 5.5 V. Communication is accomplished over a 2-wire
interface which operates up to 400kHz. The LM75 has three address pins, allowing up to eight LM75 devices to
operate on the same 2-wire bus. The LM75 has a dedicated over-temperature output (O.S.) with programmable
limit and hysteresis. This output has programmable fault tolerance, which allows the user to define the number of
consecutive error conditions that must occur before O.S. is activated.

### 7.4 Device Functional Modes

In Comparator mode the O.S. Output behaves like a thermostat. The output becomes active when temperature exceeds the TOS limit, and leaves the active state when the temperature drops below the THYST limit. In this mode the O.S. output can be used to turn a cooling fan on, initiate an emergency system shutdown, or reduce system clock speed. Shutdown mode does not reset O.S. state in a comparator mode.

In Interrupt mode exceeding TOS also makes O.S. active but O.S. will remain active indefinitely until reset by reading any register via the I2C interface. Once O.S. has been activated by crossing TOS, then reset, it can be activated again only by Temperature going below THYST. Again, it will remain active indefinitely until being reset by a read. Placing the LM75 in shutdown mode also resets the O.S. Output.

The LM75B always powers up in a known state. The power up default conditions are:

1. Comparator mode
2. TOS = 80°C
3. THYST = 75°C
4. O.S. active low
5. Pointer = “00”

When the supply voltage is less than about 1.7V, the LM75 is considered powered down. As the supply voltage rises above the nominal 1.7V power up threshold, the internal registers are reset to the power up default values listed above.

If the LM75 is not connected to the I2C bus on power up, it will act as a stand-alone thermostat with the power up default conditions listed above. It is optional, but recommended, to connect the address pins (A2, A1, A0) and the SCL and SDA pins together and to a 10k pull-up resistor to +VS for better noise immunity. Any of these pins may also be tied high separately through a 10k pull-up resistor.

### 7.5 Programming

#### 7.5.1 I2C Bus Interface

The LM75 operates as a slave on the I2C bus, so the SCL line is an input (no clock is generated by the LM75) and the SDA line is a bi-directional serial data path. According to I2C bus specifications, the LM75 has a 7-bit slave address. The four most significant bits of the slave address are hard wired inside the LM75 and are “1001”. The three least significant bits of the address are assigned to pins A2–A0, and are set by connecting these pins to ground for a low, (0); or to +VS for a high, (1).

Therefore, the complete slave address is:

| 1    | 0    | 0    | 1    | A2   | A1   | A0   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| MSB  |      |      |      |      |      | LSB  |

#### 7.5.2 Temperature Data Format

Temperature data can be read from the Temperature, TOS Set Point, and THYST Set Point registers; and written to the TOS Set Point, and THYST Set Point registers. Temperature data is represented by a 9-bit, two's complement word with an LSB (Least Significant Bit) equal to 0.5°C:

| Temperature | Digital Output Binary | Hex  |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---- |
| 125°C       | 0 1111 1010           | 0FAh |
| 25°C        | 0 0011 0010           | 032h |
| 0.5°C       | 0 0000 0001           | 001h |
| 0°C         | 0 0000 0000           | 000h |
| −0.5°C      | 1 1111 1111           | 1FFh |
| −25°C       | 1 1100 1110           | 1CEh |
| −55°C       | 1 1001 0010           | 192h |

#### 7.5.3 Shutdown Mode

Shutdown mode is enabled by setting the shutdown bit in the Configuration register via the I2C bus. Shutdown mode reduces power supply current significantly. See specified quiescent current specification in the Temperature-to-Digital Converter Characteristics table. In Interrupt mode O.S. is reset if previously set and is undefined in Comparator mode during shutdown. The I2C interface remains active. Activity on the clock and data lines of the I2C bus may slightly increase shutdown mode quiescent current. TOS, THYST, and Configuration registers can be read from and written to in shutdown mode. For the LM75B, the TIMEOUT feature is turned off in Shutdown Mode.

#### 7.5.4 Fault Queue

A fault queue of up to 6 faults is provided to prevent false tripping of O.S. when the LM75 is used in noisy environments. The number of faults set in the queue must occur consecutively to set the O.S. output.

#### 7.5.5  Comparator and Interrupt Mode

As indicated in the O.S. Output Temperature Response Diagram, Figure 9, the events that trigger O.S. are identical for either Comparator or Interrupt mode. The most important difference is that in Interrupt mode the O.S. will remain set indefinitely once it has been set. To reset O.S. while in Interrupt mode, perform a read from any register in the LM75.

#### 7.5.6  O.S. Output

The O.S. output is an open-drain output and does not have an internal pull-up. A “high” level will not be observed on this pin until pull-up current is provided from some external source, typically a pull-up resistor. Choice of resistor value depends on many system factors but, in general, the pull-up resistor should be as large as possible. This will minimize any errors due to internal heating of the LM75. The maximum resistance of the pull up, based on LM75 specification for High Level Output Current, to provide a 2V high level, is 30 kΩ.

#### 7.5.7  O.S. Polarity

The O.S. output can be programmed via the configuration register to be either active low (default mode), or active high. In active low mode the O.S. output goes low when triggered exactly as shown on the O.S. Output Temperature Response Diagram, Figure 9. Active high simply inverts the polarity of the O.S. output.

Pointer = 00000011                                     Pointer = 00000010

There are four data registers in the LM75B and LM75C selected by the Pointer register. At power-up the Pointer is set to “000”; the location for the Temperature Register. The Pointer register latches whatever the last location it was set to. In Interrupt Mode, a read from the LM75, or placing the device in shutdown mode, resets the O.S. output. All registers are read and write, except the Temperature register which is a read only.

A write to the LM75 will always include the address byte and the Pointer byte. A write to the Configuration register requires one data byte, and the TOS and THYST registers require two data bytes.

Reading the LM75 can take place either of two ways: If the location latched in the Pointer is correct (most of the time it is expected that the Pointer will point to the Temperature register because it will be the data most frequently read from the LM75), then the read can simply consist of an address byte, followed by retrieving the corresponding number of data bytes. If the Pointer needs to be set, then an address byte, pointer byte, repeat start, and another address byte will accomplish a read.

The first data byte is the most significant byte with most significant bit first, permitting only as much data as necessary to be read to determine temperature condition. For instance, if the first four bits of the temperature data indicates an overtemperature condition, the host processor could immediately take action to remedy the excessive temperatures. At the end of a read, the LM75 can accept either Acknowledge or No Acknowledge from the Master (No Acknowledge is typically used as a signal for the slave that the Master has read its last byte).

An inadvertent 8-bit read from a 16-bit register, with the D7 bit low, can cause the LM75 to stop in a state where the SDA line is held low as shown in Figure 11. This can prevent any further bus communication until at least 9 additional clock cycles have occurred. Alternatively, the master can issue clock cycles until SDA goes high, at which time issuing a “Stop” condition will reset the LM75.

When using the two-wire interface: program O.S. for active high and connect O.S. directly to Q2's gate.

##### 8.2.1.1 Design Requirements

The LM75 requires a positive supply voltage of 2.7 V to 5.5 V to be applied between +Vs and GND. For best results, bypass capacitors of 100 nF and 10 μF are recommended. Pull-up resistors of 10 kΩ are required on SCL and SDA.

##### 8.2.1.2 Detailed Design Procedure

Accessing the conversion result of the LM75 consists of writing an address byte followed by retrieving the corresponding number of data bytes. The first data byte is the most significant byte with the most significant bit first, permitting only as much data as necessary to be read to determine temperature condition. For instance, if the first four bits of the temperature data indicates an overtemperature condition, the host processor could immediately take action to remedy the excessive temperatures. At the end of a read, the LM75 can accept either Acknowledge or No Acknowledge from the Master (No Acknowledge is typically used as a signal for the slave that the Master has read its last byte). Temperature data is two's complement format and one LSB is equivalent to 0.5°C.

## 9  Power Supply Recommendations

The LM75 is specified for operation from 2.7 V to 5.5 V. Place a 100-nF and 10-μF capacitor close to +Vs in order to reduce errors coupling in from noisy or high impedance supplies.

## 10   Layout

### 10.1   Layout Guidelines

To achieve the expected results when measuring temperature with an integrated circuit temperature sensor like the LM75, it is important to understand that the sensor measures its own die temperature. For the LM75, the best thermal path between the die and the outside world is through the LM75's pins. In the VSSOP package for the LM75B and LM75C, the GND pin is directly connected to the die, so the GND pin provides the best thermal path. If the other pins are at different temperatures (unlikely, but possible), they will affect the die temperature, but not as strongly as the GND pin. In the SOIC package, none of the pins is directly connected to the die, so they will all contribute similarly to the die temperature. Because the pins represent a good thermal path to the LM75 die, the LM75 will provide an accurate measurement of the temperature of the printed circuit board on which it is mounted. There is a less efficient thermal path between the plastic package and the LM75 die. If the ambient air temperature is significantly different from the printed circuit board temperature, it will have a small effect on the measured temperature.

In probe-type applications, the LM75 can be mounted inside a sealed-end metal tube, and can then be dipped into a bath or screwed into a threaded hole in a tank. As with any IC, the LM75 and accompanying wiring and circuits must be kept insulated and dry, to avoid leakage and corrosion. This is especially true if the circuit may operate at cold temperatures where condensation can occur. Printed-circuit coatings and varnishes such as Humiseal and epoxy paints or dips are often used to insure that moisture cannot corrode the LM75 or its connections.

#### 10.1.1 Digital Noise Issues

The LM75B features an integrated low-pass filter on both the SCL and the SDA digital lines to mitigate the effects of bus noise. Although this filtering makes the LM75B communication robust in noisy environments, good layout practices are always recommended. Minimize noise coupling by keeping digital traces away from switching power supplies. Also, ensure that digital lines containing high-speed data communications cross at right angles to the SDA and SCL lines.

Excessive noise coupling into the SDA and SCL lines on the LM75C-specifically noise with amplitude greater than 400 mVpp (the LM75’s typical hysteresis), overshoot greater than 300 mV above +Vs, and undershoot more than 300 mV below GND-may prevent successful serial communication with the LM75C. Serial bus no-acknowledge is the most common symptom, causing unnecessary traffic on the bus. The layout procedures mentioned above apply also to the LM75C. Although the serial bus maximum frequency of communication is only 400 kHz, care must be taken to ensure proper termination within a system with long printed circuit board traces or multiple parts on the bus. Resistance can be added in series with the SDA and SCL lines to further help filter noise and ringing. A 5 kΩ resistor should be placed in series with the SCL line, placed as close as possible to the SCL pin on the LM75C. This 5 kΩ resistor, with the 5 pF to 10 pF stray capacitance of the LM75 provides a 6 MHz to 12 MHz low pass filter, which is sufficient filtering in most cases.

(1)  Status: For more details on status, see our product life cycle.

(2)  Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assurance, reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind.

(3)  RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.

(4)  Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum column width.

(5)  MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is shown. Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.

(6)  Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
