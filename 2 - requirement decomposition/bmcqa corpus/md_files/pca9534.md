## 2 Description

This 8-bit I/O expander for the two-line bidirectional bus (I2C) is designed for 2.3-V to 5.5-V VCC operation. It provides general-purpose remote I/O expansion for
most microcontroller families via the I2C interface
[serial clock (SCL), serial data (SDA)].
The PCA9534 consists of one 8-bit Configuration
(input or output selection), Input Port, Output Port,
and Polarity Inversion (active high or active low)
register. At power on, the I/Os are configured as
inputs. However, the system master can enable the
I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O
configuration bits. The data for each input or output
is kept in the corresponding Input or Output register.
The polarity of the Input Port register can be inverted
with the Polarity Inversion register. All registers can be
read by the system master.
The system master can reset the PCA9534 in the
event of a timeout or other improper operation by
utilizing the power-on reset feature, which puts the
registers in their default state and initializes the I2C/
SMBus state machine.
The PCA9534 open-drain interrupt ( INT) output
is activated when any input state differs from its
corresponding input port register state and is used to
indicate to the system master that an input state has
changed.

## 4 Description (Continued)

INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C bus. Thus, the PCA9534 can remain a simple slave device.

The device's outputs (latched) have high-current drive capability for directly driving LEDs. It has low current consumption.

Three hardware pins (A0, A1, and A2) are used to program and vary the fixed I2C address and allow up to eight devices to share the same I2C bus or SMBus.

The PCA9534 is pin-to-pin and I2C address compatible with the PCF8574. However, software changes are required due to the enhancements in the PCA9534 over the PCF8574.

The PCA9534 is a low-power version of the PCA9554. The only difference between the PCA9534 and PCA9554 is that the PCA9534 eliminates an internal I/O pullup resistor, which dramatically reduces power consumption in the standby mode when the I/Os are held low.

The PCA9534A and PCA9534 are identical, except for their fixed I2C address. This allows for up to 16 of these devices (8 of each) on the same I2C bus.

### 9.2 Device Functional Modes

#### 9.2.1 Power-On Reset

When power (from 0 V) is applied to VCC, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9534 in a reset condition until VCC has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the PCA9534 registers and I2C/SMBus state machine initialize to their default states. After that, VCC must be lowered to below 0.2 V and then back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle.

#### 9.2.2 I/O Port

When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 (in Figure 9-2) are off, creating a high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VCC to a maximum of 5.5 V. If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and either VCC or GND. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the recommended levels for proper operation.

#### 9.2.3 Interrupt Output (INT)

An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the input mode. After time, tiv, the signal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when data on the port is changed to the original setting, data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. Resetting occurs in the read mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Each change of the I/Os after resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT. Writing to another device does not affect the interrupt circuit, and a pin configured as an output cannot cause.

##### 9.2.3.1 Interrupt Errata

###### 9.2.3.1.1 Description

The INT will be improperly de-asserted if the following two conditions occur:

1. The last I2C command byte (register pointer) written to the device was 00h.
Note

This generally means the last operation with the device was a Read of the input register. However,
the command byte may have been written with 00h without ever going on to read the input register.
After reading from the device, if no other command byte written, it will remain 00h.
2. Any other slave device on the I2C bus acknowledges an address byte with the R/W bit set high.

###### 9.2.3.1.2 System Impact

Can cause improper interrupt handling as the Master will see the interrupt as being cleared.

###### 9.2.3.1.3 System Workaround

Minor software change: User must change command byte to something besides 00h after a Read operation to
the PCA9534 device or before reading from another slave device.
Note

Software change will be compatible with other versions (competition and TI redesigns) of this device.

### 9.3 Programming

#### 9.3.1 I2C Interface

The bidirectional I2C bus consists of the serial clock (SCL) and serial data (SDA) lines. Both lines must be
connected to a positive supply through a pullup resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data
transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.

I2C communication with this device is initiated by a master sending a Start condition, a high-to-low transition on
the SDA input/output while the SCL input is high (see Figure 9-3). After the Start condition, the device address
byte is sent, most significant bit (MSB) first, including the data direction bit (R/W).

After receiving the valid address byte, this device responds with an acknowledge (ACK), a low on the SDA
input/output during the high of the ACK-related clock pulse. The address inputs (A0–A2) of the slave device must
not be changed between the Start and Stop conditions.

On the I2C bus, only one data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
stable during the high pulse of the clock period, as changes in the data line at this time are interpreted as control
commands (Start or Stop) (see Figure 9-4).

A Stop condition, a low-to-high transition on the SDA input/output while the SCL input is high, is sent by the
master (see Figure 9-3).

Any number of data bytes can be transferred from the transmitter to receiver between the Start and Stop
conditions. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one ACK bit. The transmitter must release the SDA line before
the receiver can send an ACK bit. The device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the ACK
clock pulse so that the SDA line is stable low during the high pulse of the ACK-related clock period (see Figure
9-5). When a slave receiver is addressed, it must generate an ACK after each byte is received. Similarly, the
master must generate an ACK after each byte that it receives from the slave transmitter. Setup and hold times
must be met to ensure proper operation.

A master receiver will signal an end of data to the slave transmitter by not generating an acknowledge (NACK) after the last byte has been clocked out of the slave. This is done by the master receiver by holding the SDA line high. In this event, the transmitter must release the data line to enable the master to generate a Stop condition.

Following the successful acknowledgment of the address byte, the bus master sends a command byte, which is stored in the control register in the PCA9534. Two bits of this command byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal register (input, output, polarity inversion or configuration) that will be affected. This register can be written or read through the I2C bus. The command byte is sent only during a write transmission.

Once a command byte has been sent, the register that was addressed continues to be accessed by reads until a new command byte has been sent.

###### Table 9-3. Command Byte

##### 9.3.2.3 Register Descriptions

The Input Port register (register 0) reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. It only acts on read operation. Writes to these registers have no effect. The default value, X, is determined by the externally applied logic level.

Before a read operation, a write transmission is sent with the command byte to let the I2C device know that the Input Port register will be accessed next.

###### Table 9-4. Register 0 (Input Port Register)

| BIT     | I7   | I6   | I5   | I4   | I3   | I2   | I1   | I0   |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| DEFAULT | X    | X    | X    | X    | X    | X    | X    | X    |

The Output Port register (register 1) shows the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in this register have no effect on pins defined as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that is in the flip-flop controlling the output selection, not the actual pin value.

###### Table 9-5. Register 1 (Output Port Register)

| BIT     | O7 | O6 | O5 | O4 | O3 | O2 | O1 | O0 |
| ------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| DEFAULT | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |

The Polarity Inversion register (register 2) allows polarity inversion of pins defined as inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in this register is set (written with 1), the corresponding port pin polarity is inverted. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with 0), the corresponding port pin original polarity is retained.

###### Table 9-6. Register 2 (Polarity Inversion Register)

| BIT     | N7 | N6 | N5 | N4 | N3 | N2 | N1 | N0 |
| ------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| DEFAULT | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |

The Configuration register (register 3) configures the directions of the I/O pins. If a bit in this register is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as an input with high-impedance output driver. If a bit in this register is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin is enabled as an output.

##### 9.3.2.4 Bus Transactions

Data is exchanged between the master and PCA9534 through write and read commands.

###### 9.3.2.4.1 Writes

Data is transmitted to the PCA9534 by sending the device address and setting the least significant bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 9-6 for device address). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register receives the data that follows the command byte (see Figure 9-8 and Figure 9-9). There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission.

Data to Register

###### 9.3.2.4.2 Reads

The bus master first must send the PCA9534 address with the LSB set to a logic 0 (see Figure 9-6 for device address). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is accessed. After a restart, the device address is sent again but, this time, the LSB is set to a logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte then is sent by the PCA9534 (see Figure 9-10 and Figure 9-11). After a restart, the value of the register defined by the command byte matches the register being accessed when the restart occurred. Data is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes received in one read transmission, but when the final byte is received, the bus master must not acknowledge the data.

##### 10.1.1.1 Design Requirements

###### 10.1.1.1.1 Minimizing ICC When The I/O Controls Leds

When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VCC through a resistor, as shown in Figure 10-1. Because the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off, the I/O VIN is about 1.2 V less than VCC. The supply current, ICC, increases as VIN becomes lower than VCC and is specified as ΔICC in Electrical Characteristics.

For battery-powered applications, it is essential that the voltage of the I/O pins is greater than or equal to VCC when the LED is off to minimize current consumption. Figure 10-2 shows a high-value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 10-3 shows VCC less than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VIN at or above VCC and prevents additional supply-current consumption when the LED is off.

## 11 Power Supply Recommendations

### 11.1 Power-On Reset Requirements

In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCA9534 can be reset to its default conditions by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device is powered on for the first time in an application.

The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 11-1 and Figure 11-2.

#### Figure 11-1. VCC Is Lowered Below 0.2 V Or 0 V And Then Ramped Up To VCC

#### Figure 11-2. VCC Is Lowered Below The Por Threshold, Then Ramped Back Up To VCC

Table 11-1 specifies the performance of the power-on reset feature for PCA9534 for both types of power-on reset.

#### Table 11-1. Recommended Supply Sequencing And Ramp Rates (1)

(1) TA = –40°C to 85°C (unless otherwise noted)

Glitches in the power supply can also affect the power-on reset performance of this device. The glitch width (VCC_GW) and height (VCC_GH) are dependent on each other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and the device impedance are factors that affect power-on reset performance. Figure 11-3 and Table 11-1 provide more information on how to measure these specifications.

VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition is released and all the registers and the I2C/SMBus state machine are initialized to their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VCC being lowered to or from 0. Figure 11-4 and Table 11-1 provide more details on this specification.
